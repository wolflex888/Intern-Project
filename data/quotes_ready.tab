Small peoplealways do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, canbecome great.-- Mark Twain	What Paul does, and does very well, is to take ideas and concepts thatare beautiful in the abstract, and brings them down to a real worldlevel. That's a rare talent to find in writing these days.-- Jeff "hemos" Bates, Director, OSDN; Co-evolver, Slashdot	Since programmers create programs out of nothing, imagination is ouronly limitation. Thus, in the world of programming, the hero is the onewho has great vision. Paul Graham is one of our contemporary heroes. Hehas the ability to embrace the vision, and to express it plainly. Hisworks are my favorites, especially the ones describing language design.He explains secrets of programming, languages, and human nature that canonly be learned from the hacker experience.

Itshould deepen our understanding of the processes of design and creation,it should give us better control over the task of organizing ourthoughts. If it did not do so, to my taste we should no deserve thecomputer at all!  It has allready taught us a few lessons, and the one Ihave chosen to stress in this talk is the following. We shall do a muchbetter programming job, provided that we approach the task with a fullappreciation of its tremenduous difficulty, provided that we stick tomodest and elegant programming languages, provided that we respect theintrinsec limitations of the human mind and approach the task as VeryHumble Programmers.-- E.

The programmer must seek both perfection of part and adequacy ofcollection.-- Alan J. Perlis	Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentallyfor machines to execute.-- Alan J. Perlis	We control complexity by building abstractions that hide details whenappropriate. We control complexity by establishing conventionalinterfaces that enable us to construct systems by combining standard,well-understood pieces in a ``mix and match'' way. We control complexityby establishing new languages for describing a design, each of whichemphasizes particular aspects of the design and deemphasizes others.-- Alan J. Perlis	The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, arechiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compoundone, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing twoideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by oneanother so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them intoone, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third isseparating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their realexistence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideasare made.-- John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)	Lisp programmers know the value of everything but the cost of nothing.-- Alan J.

If you don't make it yourself, it ain'tfun -- it's entertainment.-- David Mamet (as relayed by Joss Whedon)	If we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard them as *linesproduced* but as *lines spent*.-- Edsger Dijkstra	Sometimes a man with too broad a perspective reveals himself as havingno real perspective at all. A man who tries too hard to see every sidemay be a man who is trying to avoid choosing any side. A man who triestoo hard to seek a deeper truth may be trying to hide from the truth healready knows.

And I don't just mean "someof them" or "other people". I'm talking about everyone. We have a "logicengine" in our brains, but for the most part, it's not the one in thedriver's seat -- instead it operates after the fact, generatingrationalizations and excuses for our behavior.-- Paul Buchheit	What do Americans look for in a car? I've heard many answers when I'veasked this question. The answers include excellent safety ratings, greatgas mileage, handling, and cornering ability, among others. I don'tbelieve any of these. That's because the first principle of the CultureCode is that the only effective way to understand what people truly meanis to ignore what they say. This is not to suggest that peopleintentionally lie or misrepresent themselves. What it means is that,when asked direct questions about their interests and preferences,people tend to give answers they believe the questioner wants to hear.Again, this is not because they intend to mislead. It is because peoplerespond to these questions with their cortexes, the parts of theirbrains that control intelligence rather than emotion or instinct. Theyponder a question, they process a question, and when they deliver ananswer, it is the product of deliberation. They believe they are tellingthe truth. A lie detector would confirm this. In most cases, however,they aren't saying what they mean.-- The culture code.

The only way to be a good programmeris to write code. When you realize you haven't been writing much codelately, and it seems like all you do is brag about code you wrote in thepast, and people start looking at you funny while you're shooting yourmouth off, realize it's because they know. They might not even know theyknow, but they know.

If I tellyou I'm no good, you know I'm lying.-- Bruce Lee	Let me try to get this straight: Lisp is a language for describingalgorithms. This was JohnMcCarthy's original purpose, anyway: to buildsomething more convenient than a Turing machine. Lisp is not about file,socket or GUI programming - Lisp is about expressive power. (Forexample, you can design multiple object systems for Lisp, in Lisp. Orimplement the now-fashionable AOP. Or do arbitrary transformations onparsed source code.)

It is not my purpose to "transfer knowledge" to you that,subsequently, you can forget again. My purpose is no less than toeffectuate in each of you a noticeable, irreversable change. I want youto gain, for the rest of your lives, the insight that beautiful proofsare not "found" by trial anf error but are the result of a consciouslyapplied design discipline. I want you to raise your quality standards. Imean, if 10 years from now, when you are doing something quick anddirty, you suddenly visualize that I am looking over your shoulders andsay to yourself "Dijkstra would not have liked this", well, that wouldbe enough immortality for me.-- E. W. Dijkstra	The general principle for complexity design is this: Think locally, actlocally.-- Richard P. Gabriel & Ron Goldman, Mob Software: The Erotic Life of Code	Programming is the art of figuring out what you want so precisely thateven a machine can do it.-- Some guy who isn't famous	Hence my urgent advice to all of you to reject the morals of thebestseller society and to find, to start with, your reward in your ownfun. This is quite feasible, for the challenge of simplification is sofascinating that, if we do our job properly, we shall have the greatestfun in the world.-- E. W. Dijkstra, On the nature of computing science.	Remember: you are alone. Every time you can get help from someone,it is an opportunity: you should eagerly size it.

Great artists steal.-- Pablo Picasso	A guideline in the process of stepwise refinement should be theprinciple to decompose decisions as much as possible, to untangleaspects which are only seemingly interdependent, and to defer thosedecisions which concern details of representation as long as possible.-- Niklaus Wirth	Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessarywords, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that adrawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessaryparts. This requires not that the writer make all sentences short oravoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that every wordtell.-- William Strunk, Jr. (The Elements of Style)	The problem is that small examples fail to convince, and large examplesare too big to follow.-- Steve Yegge.	We are the sum of our behaviours; excellence therefore is not an act buta habit.-- Aristotle.	The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a newsemantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.-- Edsger Dijkstra	Every man prefers belief to the exercise of judgment.-- Seneca	It’s hard to grasp abstractions if you don’t understand what they’reabstracting away from.-- Nathan Weizenbaum	That is one of the most distinctive differences between school and thereal world: there is no reward for putting in a good effort. In fact,the whole concept of a "good effort" is a fake idea adults invented toencourage kids. It is not found in nature.-- Paul Graham	I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.-- Thomas Jefferson	Don't stay in bed, unless you can make money in bed.-- George Burns	If everything seems under control, you're not going fast enough.-- Mario Andretti	Chance favors the prepared mind.-- Louis Pasteur	Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.-- Brian Kernigan	The function of good software is to make the complex appear to besimple.-- Grady Booch	Programmers are in a race with the Universe to create bigger and betteridiot-proof programs, while the Universe is trying to create bigger andbetter idiots.  So far the Universe is winning.-- Rich Cook	A hacker on a roll may be able to produce–in a period of a fewmonths–something that a small development group (say, 7-8 people) wouldhave a hard time getting together over a year.  IBM used to report thatcertain programmers might be as much as 100 times as productive as otherworkers, or more.-- Peter Seebach	The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones.They are an order-of-magnitude better, measured by whatever standard:conceptual creativity, speed, ingenuity of design, or problem-solvingability.-- Randall E. Stross	A great lathe operator commands several times the wage of an averagelathe operator, but a great writer of software code is worth 10,000times the price of an average software writer.-- Bill Gates	Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuringaircraft building progress by weight.-- Bill Gates	First learn computer science and all the theory.

My compromise of 0.5 was rejectedwithout, I thought, proper consideration.-- Stan Kelly-Bootle	The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should therefore beregarded as a criminal offense.-- E.W. Dijkstra	It is practically impossible to teach good programming style to studentsthat have had prior exposure to BASIC.  As potential programmers, theyare mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.-- E. W.

Watson, Chairman of the Board, IBM, circa 1948	It would appear that we have reached the limits of what it is possibleto achieve with computer technology, although one should be careful withsuch statements, as they tend to sound pretty silly in 5 years.-- John Von Neumann, circa 1949	But what is it good for?-- Engineer at the Advanced Computing Systems Division of IBM,commenting on the microchip, 1968	There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.-- Ken Olson, President, Digital Equipment Corporation, 1977	640K ought to be enough for anybody.-- Bill Gates, 1981	Windows NT addresses 2 Gigabytes of RAM, which is more than anyapplication will ever need.-- Microsoft, on the development of Windows NT, 1992	We will never become a truly paper-less society until the Palm Pilotfolks come out with WipeMe 1.0.-- Andy Pierson	If it keeps up, man will atrophy all his limbs but the push-buttonfinger.-- Frank Lloyd Wright	Functional programming is like describing your problem to amathematician.  Imperative programming is like giving instructions toan idiot.-- arcus, #scheme on Freenode	Its a shame that the students of our generation grew up with windows andmice because that tainted our mindset not to think in terms of powerfultools. Some of us are just so tainted that we will never recover.-- Jeffrey Mark Siskind <qobi@research.nj.nec.com> in comp.lang.lisp	Lisp is a programmable programming language.-- John Foderaro	I guess, when you're drunk, every woman looks beautiful and everylanguage looks (like) a Lisp :)-- Lament, #scheme@freenode.net	Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close theywere to success when they gave up.-- Thomas Edison	You must always work not just within but below your means. If you canhandle three elements, handle only two. If you can handle ten, thenhandle five. In that way the ones you do handle, you handle with moreease, more mastery and you create a feeling of strength in reserve.-- Pablo Picasso	When you’ve got the code all ripped apart, it’s like a car that’s alldisassembled. You’ve got all the parts tying all over your garage andyou have to replace the broken part or the car will never run. It’s notfun until the code gets back to the baseline again.-- Gary Kildall (inventor of CP/M, one of the first OS for the micro).		Well, if you talk about programming to a group of programmers who usethe same language, they can become almost evangelistic about thelanguage. They form a tight-knit community, hold to certain beliefs, andfollow certain rules in their programming. It’s like a church with aprogramming language for a Bible.-- Gary Kildall (inventor of CP/M, one of the first OS for the micro).	It’s a problem if the design doesn’t let you add features at a laterdate. If you have to redo a program, the hours you spend can cause youto lose your competitive edge. A flexible program demonstrates thedifference between a good designer and someone who is just getting apiece of code out.-- Gary Kildall (inventor of CP/M, one of the first OS for the micro).	[How friendly will this machine be?] Well, I don’t think it’s a matterof friendliness, because ultimately if the program is going toaccomplish anything of value, it will probably be relatively complex.-- Gary Kildall (inventor of CP/M, one of the first OS for the micro).	Some people suggest that machines would be friendlier if input could bein a natural language. But natural language is probably the worst kindof input because it can be quite ambiguous. The process of retrievinginformation from the computer would be so time-consuming that you wouldbe better off spending that time getting the information directly froman expert.-- Gary Kildall (inventor of CP/M, one of the first OS for the micro).	The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture alittle way past them into the impossible.-- Arthur C. Clarke	Any sufficiently advanced technology is undistinguishable from magic.-- Arthur C. Clarke	That is the inevitable human response. We’re reluctant to believe thatgreat discoveries are in the air. We want to believe that greatdiscoveries are in our heads—and to each party in the multiple thepresence of the other party is invariably cause for suspicion.-- Malcolm Gladwell, Who says big ideas are rare?	Good ideas are out there for anyone with the wit and the will to findthem.-- Malcolm Gladwell, Who says big ideas are rare?	A person won't become proficient at something until he or she has doneit many times. In other words., if you want someone to be really good atbuilding a software system, he or she will have to have built 10 or moresystems of that type.-- Philip Greenspun	A person won't retain proficiency at a task unless he or she has at onetime learned to perform that task very rapidly. Learning researchdemonstrates that the skills of people who become accurate but not fastdeteriorate much sooner than the skills of people who become bothaccurate and fast.-- Philip Greenspun	Training research shows that if you get speed now you can get qualitylater. But if you don't get speed you will never get quality in the longrun.-- Philip Greenspun	Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, nottried it.-- Donald Knuth	Wear your best for your execution and stand dignified. Your lastrecourse against randomness is how you act — if you can’t controloutcomes, you can control the elegance of your behaviour. You willalways have the last word.-- Nassim Taleb	The human brain starts working the moment you are born and never stopsuntil you stand up to speak in public.-- Anonymous	The trouble with the world is that the stupid are always cocksure andthe intelligent are always filled with doubt.-- Bertrand Russell	Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex, intelligentbehavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple, stupidbehavior.-- Dee Hock, Birth of the Chaordic Age	C++ is like teenage sex: Everybody is talking about it all the time,only few are really doing it.-- unknown	Functional programming is to algorithms as the ubiquitous little blackdress is to women's fashion.-- Mark Tarver (of "The bipolar Lisp programmer" fame)	Java and C++ make you think that the new ideas are like the old ones.Java is the most distressing thing to hit computing since MS-DOS.-- Alan Kay	For complex systems, the compiler and development environment need to bein the same language that its supporting.

If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it'sa duck.-- Official definition of "duck typing"	In OO, it's the data that is the "important" thing: you define the classwhich contains member data, and only incidentally contains code formanipulating the object. In FP, it's the code that's important: youdefine a function which contains code for working with the data, andonly incidentally define what the data is.-- almkgor, on reddit	Des mots simples, quand ils sont bien utilisés, font faire à des gensordinaires des choses extraordinaires.-- Khaled TANGAO	It was Edison who said ‘1% inspiration, 99% perspiration’.
